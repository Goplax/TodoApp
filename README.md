# TODO list app

A simple TODO list application consisting of a single activity. The activity shows two views arranged vertically: an EditText view, and a ListView view. The user types a string in the EditText view, and the ListView will be updated with the new string placed in the top of the list.

1: Use of an ArrayAdapter to bind an ArrayList containing the string list to the ListView.
2: To capture the input action of the user on the EditText view the setOnKeyListener of this view is implemented.
