# TodoApp

Exercise III â€“ TODO list app
Implement a simple TODO list application consisting of a single activity. The activity must show two views arranged vertically: an EditText view, and a ListView view. The user types a string in the EditText view, and the ListView will be updated with the new string placed in the top of the list.

Hint 1: Use an ArrayAdapter to bind an ArrayList containing the string list to the ListView.
Hint 2: To capture the input action of the user on the EditText view, implement setOnKeyListener of this view.
